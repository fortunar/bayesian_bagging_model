get_transformation(transformation)

\description{
Returns a function representing the object transformation (i.e. way of obtaining
feature vectors from first level models of objects). Returns the function itself
if a function is passed in as parameter. If a string is passed, it has to be one
of the supported transformations (currently only "means").
